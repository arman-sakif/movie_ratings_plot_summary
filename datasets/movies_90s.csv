The only person to help her was her close friend Siddheswari, who ran from the kitchen to hug her cousin, and took the thrashing on her own body. At this point, Siddheswari told her weeping cousin, ""It's not so difficult to sing what Siyaji Maharaj was telling you."" Siddheswari then showed her how to sing it, performing the whole tune perfectly, much to the amazement of everyone.

The next day, Siyaji Maharaj came to Rajeshwari, and asked to adopt Siddheswari into his own family (they were childless). So Siddheswari moved in with the couple, eventually becoming a great friend and support for them.

Wrestling with God,1990,7.1,33.0,"Wrestling with God is the true story of Alexander Campbell, a man whose conscience came into conflict with the accepted religious precepts of his time, and the struggle and resentment he endured as a result. Campbell challenged the man-made doctrines of religious organizations to find his own form of personal faith. As the film begins, Thomas Campbell, an Irish minister, has left his home and ministry to settle in America, leaving his eldest son, Alexander to bring the rest of the family after he establishes himself in the new land. During 1808, the family was shipwrecked and forced to regroup in Glasgow, Scotland. Alexander spent the time studying at university and became disenchanted with the hypocrisy of the clerical establishment, severing himself from the church. Arriving in Eastern Pennsylvania, the family is reunited with Thomas, but Alexander dreads having to explain his act to his father. Finally forced to confront the situation, Alexander is amazed to find his father understands, having been through a similar experience with the local clerics who bicker incessantly over doctrinal minutiae. The two resolve to champion the cause of uniting all Christians into one peaceful, ecumenical body. Alexander meets and marries Margaret Brown. She becomes a strong influence, coaxing Alexander to utilize his gifts and involve himself in public debates with other groups. The resultant debates launch the movement that grows with Alexander's reputation and influence in matters both religious and political. The family suffers the loss of a child and finds Alexander in a whirlwind of public controversy over his positions. America in the earlggious thought. The Scottish Socialist, Robert Owen, later a mentor to Karl Marx, establishes experimental socialistic communities in Ohio and seeks a debate over the existence of God. Alexander accepts. Margaret is taken ill and dies suddenly, leaving Alexander with their five surviving daughters and admonishing him to always be true to the voice in his heart. In Cincinnati, before a sanctuary packed with humanity from both camps, Campbell faces Robert Owen in a debate that lasts seven days. Without a definitive resolution, Owen concedes that he is convinced at least to re-examine the source of Campbell's passion. Alexander rides home alone, weary, but heartened to move into his future. The source of Alexander Campbell's passion fired within him a heroic vision of religious liberty. The power of that passion drove him through 37 more years of tireless advocacy. Campbell became eminent in many fields an enlightened advocate of educational reform, an exponent of political reform, a champion of human liberty, a challenger of injustice and universally esteemed by the great figures of his day, friend and foe alike, as a man of wisdom, integrity, and vision. The voice in his heart rippled through the new country and beyond.",1h 11m

Post No Bills,1991,7.1,42.0,"Political heavy-weights populate this urgent and humorous documentary on the detonative mix of art and politics as embodied in the work of infamous ""guerilla"" poster artist Robbie Conal, a professional painter who estimates that hundreds of thousands of his caricatured paintings-as-posters have been splattered across the United States' urban streets, militantly affixed by himself and his cult following of urban guerilla volunteers to construction sites, traffic light switching boxes and any other surface area large enough to house one of these satirical images. Specializing in what he calls ""info-tainment,"" Conal's posters offer an immediate response to today's headlines through the expressionistically decaying depiction of the socially and politically powerful accompanied by several words of dichotomous text. Beginning in 1986 with the onset of the Iran-Contra scandal, Conal has distributed his work in a way even Andy Warhol might not have dreamed possible. As Conal modestly points out, ""these are some of the most famous paintings of any contemporary artist because I make you see them whether you want to or not."" The original canvases, from which the posters are reproduced, simultaneously grace elite gallery walls and wealthy collectors' homes. Post No Bills foregrounds the tension between Conal's creative process and the lures of a desperate notoriety achieved through catering to the newsmedia's craving for controversy in his journey to express himself and benefit from the notoriety generated from his endeavors. In September 1990, after ""reasonably outspoken"" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates casually stated that ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and shot,"" Conal began collaboration with student Patrick Crowley on a poster criticizing this hyperbolic remark. When an outraged world focused on Los Angeles in March of 1991 with the release of the graphic video footage of the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers, Conal and Crowley took to the L.A. streets his most daring, inciting and inflammatory image to date; a poster depicting the police chief on a full torso N.R.A. shooting target with the text ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and beaten. Post No Bills concentrates on this poster of Gates, including an interview with the beleaguered Chief himself, celebrating the potential of this piece of political street art and exposing the dissociation to be made between Conal and his subject matter.",57m

Ebbe Traberg plays Traberg, a mystical character who cannot be explained psychologically and whose seemingly covert activities care only hinted at in pictures. We follow him from a could of locations in Northern Spain (which the genuine Traberg was attached to, including the pelotafrontóns of the Pays Basques) to Haiti, where the film changes character. A narrator comes clean right from the start: ""I didn't know where it would lead me. It was this thing about my old friend Traberg. I wanted to tell a simple story. But it was harder than I thought"". The difficulty with the fictional story is that the genuine events (a military coup and the inauguration of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president in 1991) are so intrusive that the narrator pretty much loses interest in Traberg and works in a hectic documentary style instead, although in the closing shots a resolution of the Traberg story is hinted at. The film also contains several detached scenes from Haiti, including sensual, dark dance shots, a series of adages pronounced by an elderly gentleman, conveyed by fading up and down, a girl bringing cocktails for the film crew at the Hotel Oloffsen, etc. This material points clearly forward in time to Haiti.

Their world was the streets, set against a backdrop of uprooted families, cultural alienation, drugs and violence. Neighborhood teenagers responded by organizing into street groups known to the members as ""families"", but labeled in the most alarming terms as violent gangs by the press. In fact, the ""families"" had a stabilizing effect, enabling the youths to cope with their troubled environment. The political climate at the time, movements of national liberation and such organizations as the Black Panthers and Young Lords Party influenced the young gang leaders to aspire to be more than warriors and to become, to some degree, a positive force in their communities. When Rita Fecher returned after twenty years to see what had become of her old friends, she found that they had stayed in the community of their youth, that they were deeply committed to improving conditions there and that they were engaged in helping their own children survive in the hazardous street environment. The documentation of these lives over a twenty-year period offers a remarkable perspective on life in the ghetto (spanning four generations), and the means that people devise to cope from the time that they are children to when they serve as parents and role models for a new generation.",1h

Louis: The Child King,1993,6.2,314.0,"The title of this major French costume drama means ""Louis, child-king"", and indeed it's a fascinating fresco about the formative years of the young king Louis XIV, before he became the Sun-king at Versailles. It was a dark and violent period, when the Louvre (meaning 'wolves hunt castle', hunting was a major aristocratic pastime), then still the somewhat gloomy royal palace, was the battle field of palace intrigues while the regency was held by queen-mother Anne of Austria but the actual head of the royal government was the aging cardinal Giulio Mazirini ('Mazarin'), the less-known Italian successor of Richelieu, who also introduced to the court and the kingdom a host of his countrymen from whom Louis would learn the passion for Italian culture, especially music which would flourish under the direction of Lully (but that later story is another movie, ""Le Roi danse""). The elaborate script sketches the story of French power politics, too complicate and devious to summarize in any detail, but mainly from the viewpoint of the immature king under maternal guardianship, who probably didn't comprehend half of the grave troubles focusing on the strife between the official Catholic church and those claiming freedom of religion, especially for the Huguenots, but in reality mainly driven by personal and family ambitions and the grip of nobles on the kingdom at the expense of the royal power, and climaxing in a full rebellion, known as the Fronde, which forces the royal family to flee for their lives, an experience that may have decided Louis to dedicate his reign to preventing a repeat by establishing absolutism as he did. Some narration is done by Louis's younger brother Philip, the duke of Anjou, who seems smarter but as the spare heir is condemned to life in a golden cage, overshadowed by Louis while any 'disrespect' for his crowned sibling is punishable on the spot by strap lashes administered on his bare behind by a servant.",2h 40m

The main character is changed from a woman into a man.

The main character then goes off to live a life as a simple, unknown everyday Soviet, but is inexplicably drawn into larger and larger schemes (somewhat reminiscent of ""Forrest Gump"" in that way). (s)He has run-ins with different important characters, including his ex-boyfriend from his days of being a woman, as well as going on a demented quest for the nurse with whom he possibly fell in love after the operation - However, he is trapped in his life as an important Soviet married man, and in the end makes a huge sacrifice for his country (unwillingly), and the movie goes from there to an ending that is possibly happy, yet still somehow incredibly depressing.",1h 33m

The Bielski Brothers,1994,8.3,31.0,"The Bielskis were the only Jewish family in their tiny village of Stankevich, and while Jews in Belorussia were persecuted under tsarist rule, the family managed to maintain a successful mill. In June 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded its former ally the Soviet Union, conditions for Jews worsened immediately. Jewish ghettos were established in the nearby cities of Novogrudek and Lida, which early in the war were the sites of several mass killings of Jews. Nazis combed the countryside, and the Bielski parents and two siblings were taken to their deaths. As the gravity of the situation dawned on them, three Bielski brothers, Tuvia, Asael and Zus, who had been finding shelter with sympathetic gentiles, decided that their only hope for survival lay in the dense surrounding forests that they knew so well. Once theyd gathered their remaining relatives, the brothers, under Tuvias leadership, staged daring rescues in Novogrudek and Lida in an effort to bring as many Jews as possible to the forest with them. While they procured weapons and supplies to kill enemy soldiers and sabotage their operations, the Bielskis priority was the preservation of their people. Tuvia often declared that he would rather save one old Jewish woman than kill 10 Nazis.

Their mobility was facilitated by the fact that in addition to their native Yiddish, they could speak Russian and German; Tuvias less-recognizably-Jewish appearance enabled him to pass as a gentile. They were also aided by non-Jewish peasants with whom theyd grown upone in particular put his own family at great risk by providing food and shelter to Jews who had escaped the ghettos and were searching for the rumored Jerusalem in the woods. 

As more skilled workers arrived with their supplies, the once-primitive encampment evolved, complete with a kitchen, a mill, a bathhouse, a medical facility and other institutions of civil society. By the time Red Army troops overran the Germans, in the summer of 1944, the Bielskis had around 1,200 men, women and children in their charge, making theirs easily the largest rescue of Jews by Jews during World War II. During their two and a half years in the forest, the group endured several German raids and lost only 50 members of their unit. The Bielskis estimated that they killed more than 250 enemy fighters. The groups astounding ability to overcome dire circumstances makes one wonder how much simple luck played a part in their survival. Tuvia felt that God was guiding him somehow, but they had their fair share of luck,",50m

Goyo es uno de los miles de jóvenes de baja extracción social que, a finales de siglo, fueron reclutados a la fuerza y condenados a pelear hasta la muerte en una isla tan lejana como bella.

Light Darkness and Colour,1998,7.8,55.0,"Using Goethe's Theory of Colours (Zur Farbenlehre) as point of departure, Light Darkness and Colours takes us on a fascinating journey through the universe of colours. In 1704, Sir Isaac Newton published *Light and Refraction*, his study of the interactions between sunlight and prisms. Newton was, as a good scientist, intent on achieving objectivity, which meant studying sunlight in isolation. He thought colours were contained solely in light, and found the spectrum he was looking for. When he reproduced this experiment, Goethe found another, hidden set of colours missed by Newton. Goethe found the hidden colours in the boundaries between light and darkness. He felt, as an artist, that one could not talk about light without including darkness. Calling it 'the light-darkness polarity', Goethe made this new scientific discovery using artistic methods in conjunction with science. As far as scientists were concerned, Goethe was a layman, which meant that his research went largely ignored. Not until many years later was it recognized how revolutionary his scientific discoveries really were. Goethe spent more than 40 years of his life on *Zur Farbenlehre*, which in its own way summarizes the whole of his thinking and connects his poetry with science. Goethe himself viewed his work as so stunningly radical that he prophesied that it would only be understood generations after his death. In keeping with Goethe's method, the three directors work from a personal curiosity as they explore the natural laws and phenomena surrounding human sensory perception. Using strikingly beautiful time-lapse cinematography, and duplicating Goethe's and Newton's experiments on camera, they have crafted a visually stunning and intellectually rewarding film.",52m

(New York Daily News). A magical World War II tale of resilience and love, ""The Children of Chabannes"" reveals the previously untold story of how the people in a tiny village in unoccupied France chose action over indifference to save the lives of 400 Jewish refugee children. Returning to the forgotten corner of France with her father and uncle (two of the saved children), filmmaker Lisa Gossels and co-director Dean Wetherell movingly recreated the joys and fears of daily life in Chabannes during the war. Through warm and wonderful accounts from the educators, townspeople and from the children themselves, we see how this oasis of hope is shattered in August of 1942, when the war reaches the doorsteps of the crumbling chateau where the children lived. A celebration of human kindness, ""The Children of Chabannes"" delivers a profound message of tolerance.
